## Description
_Building an API: API of Choice_    
* This API allows users to gather information on different types of coffees. 
The objective of this lesson is to create a Rails API using RESTful principles, exploring the following topics:
* Building an API that includes full CRUD functionality and nested routes
* Successfully returning JSON objects via Postman and cURL
* Returning headers with the correct HTTP status code
* Testing APIs with rspec request specs
* Documenting your API endpoints
* Handling exceptions when an API call fails

## How To Make an API Call
1. clone project
2. do all the rake commands
3. create a user or something
4. open rails console and see user api key that was generated on creation
5. open some sort of API call application thing (recommend Postman)
6. start you server with "Rails S"

## How to make API calls

**To see a list of all existing coffees:**  
1. Make a GET request using the URL: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/coffees
2. In order to make a successful api call, you must pass your api key into the header of the call. 
3. Type "X-Api-Key" into the first key input box and then paste your api key in the value input box.
Example using the <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> app:  
<img src="./public/getrequest.PNG">

You should see a JSON response with all of the coffees with the parameters "blend_name", "origin", and "notes".

**To see a single coffee value based on its id:**  
1. Make a GET request using the URL: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/coffees/:id with :id being some integer value (ex: 1,2 or 3)
2. Make sure to add your API key in the call, covered in the previous steps.

You should see a JSON response with a single coffee with the parameters "blend_name", "origin", and "notes".
